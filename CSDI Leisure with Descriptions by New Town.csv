12,12,Tin Sau Road Swimming Pool,22.4669075,114.0022181,3.3,47,"Newly built with modern design, the pool has 50m main pool with indoor training pool. The deck area is quite big but not enough sunbath area. The changing room is quite small in terms of corridor width, making it quite hard to get stuff if someone is occupying. The shower cubic however is quite clean and neat with the modern design; I like how the toilets are big and how there is a jacuzzi along with 3 big swimming pool. The biggest one is 1.90m deep; Admittance is cheap, 18 HKD regular fee. The locker / shower / changing area is very spacious compared to other nearby swimming pools.

When I was there - 2024-11-08, about 11 AM - attendance was 94 according to the display at the entrance. All the lanes were quite busy, with about 3 swimmers per lane on average. I swim quite a bit faster than the average Tin Shui Wai swimmer, but quite slow for European standards (about 35-60 seconds per 25m), and it was frustrating that I constantly had to switch lanes to avoid other swimmers or to overtake slow swimmers.

However, the nearby Ping Shan pool is much worse, with about 5-8 people per lane, half of them children in classes who keep splashing water wildly with their footstroke practice. So by comparison, it's not so busy here.

What's a bit astounding is that despite this swimming pool having been built recently, it's closed half the time (due to a shortage of lifeguards or something) and despite the day temperatures being around 30C, the outdoor pools are closed.

For how many people live nearby and how much demand there clearly is, they should have used more area for swimming than for empty space. The path from the changing area to the pool is quite long, and for some reason they make the air temperature quite low, and the water was actually a bit cooler than at Ping Shan. For active swimming, it would be nice, if only the average swimming pace was high enough that you could swim strongly enough to get warm.

Getting out of the water feels difficult because the air is so cold and the AC fans blow very strongly. I don't get the point. The whirlpool is a bit warmer, but not warm enough to leave you with some residual heat when you get out.

At least the showers have hot water so you can get warm there again.
